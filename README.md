# 🖥️ Operating Systems Lab Experiments (Ubuntu)

This repository contains Operating Systems lab experiments performed using Ubuntu Linux.  
The experiments focus on understanding core OS concepts through practical implementation using Linux commands and C programs.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand core Operating System concepts
- Gain hands-on experience with Ubuntu/Linux commands
- Learn process management, memory management, file systems, and CPU scheduling
- Implement basic OS algorithms using C
- Develop familiarity with terminal-based operations

---

## 🛠️ Environment Used

- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
- Shell: Bash
- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC

## 📂 List of Experiments

### 🔹 1. Basic Linux Commands
- File & Directory management (`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`)
- File operations (`cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `touch`)
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Process commands (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)
- Disk usage (`df`, `du`)
- Manual/help commands (`man`, `--help`)

### 🔹 2. Process Management
- Creating processes using `fork()`
- Zombie & Orphan processes
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Process synchronization

### 🔹 3. CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin Scheduling

### 🔹 4. Memory Management
- Paging
- Segmentation
- Page Replacement Algorithms:
  - FIFO
  - LRU
  - Optimal

### 🔹 5. File System Concepts
